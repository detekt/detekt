The rule authors ruleset provides rules that ensures good practices when writing detekt rules.

**Note: The `ruleauthors` rule set is not included in the detekt-cli or Gradle plugin.**

To enable this rule set, add `detektPlugins "io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt:detekt-rules-ruleauthors:$version"`
to your Gradle `dependencies` or reference the `detekt-rules-ruleauthors`-jar with the `--plugins` option
in the command line interface.

### UseEntityAtName

If a rule [report]s issues using [Entity.from] with [KtNamedDeclaration.getNameIdentifier],
then it can be replaced with [Entity.atName] for more semantic code and better baseline support.

**Active by default**: Yes - Since v1.22.0

### ViolatesTypeResolutionRequirements

If a rule uses the property [BaseRule.bindingContext] should be annotated with `@RequiresTypeResolution`.
And if the rule doesn't use that property it shouldn't be annotated with it.
