## Formats

In addition to the CLI output, detekt supports 4 different types of output reporting formats.
You can refer to [CLI](/docs/gettingstarted/cli) or [Gradle](/docs/gettingstarted/gradle) to find
out how to configure these report formats.

### HTML
HTML is a human-readable format that can be open through browser. It includes different metrics
and complexity reports of this run, in addition to the findings with detailed descriptions and
report. Check out the example: ![HTML report](/img/tutorial/html.png)

### XML
XML is a machine-readable format that can be integrated with CI tools. It is compatible with
[Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) output.

### SARIF
[SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) is a standard format for the output of 
static analysis tools. It is a JSON format with a defined 
[schema](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.0/csprd02/schemas/). It is currently supported
by GitHub Code Scanning, and we expect more consuming tools will adopt this format in the future.

### MD
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
The output structure looks similar to HTML format.
About [markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-markdown-) on GitHub.

## Relative path
In a shared codebase, it is often required to use relative path so that all developers and tooling
have a consistent view. This can be enabled by CLI option `--base-path` or Gradle as the following:

### Kotlin DSL
```kotlin
detekt {
    basePath.set(projectDir)
}
```

### Groovy DSL
```groovy
detekt {
    basePath = projectDir
}
```

Note that this option only affects file paths in those formats for machine consumers,
namely XML and SARIF.

## Merging reports

:::caution Attention

**Gradle 7.4 or higher is required**. Earlier Gradle prevent tasks running if they depend on a failing task, so merge
tasks will not run if detekt finds issues.

:::

The machine-readable report formats support report merging.
Detekt Gradle Plugin is not opinionated in how merging is set up and respects each project's build logic, especially 
the merging makes most sense in a multi-module project. In this spirit, only Gradle tasks are provided.

At the moment, merging XML and SARIF are supported. You can refer to the sample build script below and 
run `./gradlew detekt reportMerge --continue` to execute detekt tasks and merge the corresponding reports.

### Groovy DSL
```groovy
tasks.register("reportMerge", io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.report.ReportMergeTask) {
  output = project.layout.buildDirectory.file("reports/detekt/merge.xml") // or "reports/detekt/merge.sarif"
}

subprojects {
  detekt {
    reports.xml.required.set(true)
    // reports.sarif.required.set(true)
  }

  reportMerge.configure {
    input.from(tasks.withType(io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.Detekt).collect { it.reports.xml.outputLocation }) // or sarif.outputLocation
  }
}
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
val reportMerge by tasks.registering(io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.report.ReportMergeTask::class) { 
  output.set(rootProject.layout.buildDirectory.file("reports/detekt/merge.xml")) // or "reports/detekt/merge.sarif"
}

subprojects {
  detekt {
    reports.xml.required.set(true)
    // reports.sarif.required.set(true)
  }

  reportMerge {
    input.from(tasks.withType<io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.Detekt>().map { it.reports.xml.outputLocation }) // or sarif.outputLocation
  }
}
```

## Integration with GitHub Code Scanning
If your repository is hosted on GitHub, you can enable SARIF output in your repository.
You can follow to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github).

To change the severity level to fail your GitHub Action build configure it in [GitHub Settings](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure).

You can follow the example below as a quick start:
```yaml
jobs:
  without-type-resolution:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GRADLE_OPTS: -Dorg.gradle.daemon=false
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: 11

      - name: Run detekt
        run: ./gradlew detekt

      # Make sure we always run this upload task,
      # because the previous step may fail if there are findings.
      - name: Upload SARIF to GitHub using the upload-sarif action
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        if: success() || failure()
        with:
          sarif_file: build/reports/detekt/detekt.sarif
```

Note: you'll have to set `Detekt.basePath` on each Detekt Gradle task,
so that GitHub knows where the repository is to place annotations correctly.
```gradle
basePath = rootProject.projectDir.absolutePath
```
