# Contributing to detekt

- Read [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) before writing commit messages
- `detekt` itself should not report any new errors
- This repo uses tabs!
- Use idea-code-style.xml for coding style 
- Run `detektFormat` before commiting
- Make sure `when {` or `object : MyType { ... ` is on the same line as `=` eg. 
```kotlin
    fun stuff(x: Int) = when(x) {
        1..10 -> ...
        else -> ...
    }
```

### When implementing new rules ...

- ... do not forget to add the new rule to a `RuleSetProvider`.
- ... do not forget to add the new rule to the `default-detekt-config.yml` in the `detekt-cli-resources`.
- ... do not forget to write a description for the issue of the new rule.
- be aware that your PR will stay open for at least two days so that other users can give feedback.
- make sure to set the new rule `active: false` in the default config. Brave users can test it on demand. 
After some time and testing there is a chance this rule will become active on default.
