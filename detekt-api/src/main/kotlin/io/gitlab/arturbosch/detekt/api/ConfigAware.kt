/**
 * Interface which is implemented by each Rule class to provide
 * utility functions to retrieve specific or generic properties
 * from the underlying detekt configuration file.
 *
 * Be aware that there are three config levels by default:
 * - the top level config layer specifies rule sets and detekt engine properties
 * - the rule set level specifies properties concerning the whole rule set and rules
 * - the rule level provides additional properties which are used to configure rules
 *
 * This interface operates on the rule set level as the rule set config is passed to each
 * rule in the #RuleSetProvider interface. This is due the fact that users create the
 * rule set and all rules upfront and letting them 'sub config' the rule set config would
 * be error-prone.
