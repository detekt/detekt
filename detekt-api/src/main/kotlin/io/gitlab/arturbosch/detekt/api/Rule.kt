 * A rule defines how one specific code structure should look like. If code is found

 * A rule is implemented using the visitor pattern and should be started using the visit(KtFile)
 * function. If calculations must be done before or after the visiting process, here are
 * two predefined (preVisit/postVisit) functions which can be overridden to setup/teardown additional data.
