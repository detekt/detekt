/**
 * This rule reports documentation above private properties. This can indicate that the property has a
 * confusing name or is not in a small enough context to be understood.
 * Private properties should be named in a self-explanatory way and readers of the code should be able to understand
 * why the property exists and what purpose it solves without the documentation.
 *
 * Instead of simply removing the documentation to solve this issue, prefer renaming the property to a more
 * self-explanatory name. If this property is inside a bigger class, it makes sense to refactor and split up the class.
 * This can increase readability and make the documentation obsolete.
