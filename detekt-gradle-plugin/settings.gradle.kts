// DO NOT DELETE - REQUIRED FOR PROPER INTELLIJ GRADLE INTEGRATION

// If this file is removed it is not possible to run a task in the included build  directly from the Gradle Tool Window
// in IntelliJ, and this error will  be shown:
// Project directory '...\detekt\detekt-gradle-plugin' is not part of the build defined by settings file '...\detekt\settings.gradle.kts'. If this is an unrelated build, it must have its own settings file.
